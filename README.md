# Intune Documentation
Automatic Intune Documentation to simplify the life of admins and consultants.

This Script will document:
 - Configuration Policies
 - Compliance Policies
 - Device Enrollment Restrictions
 - Terms and Conditions
 - Applications (Only Assigned)
 - Conditional Access
 - AutoPilot Configuration
 
# Usage
Download the DocumentIntune.ps1 file and execute it with PowerShell.exe:

```
powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file DocumentIntune.ps1
```
The Documentation will be created in the same folder like the DocumentIntune.ps1 file resides.

**Important:** Before using the Script the first time, you have to ensure, that you have installed and imported the AzureRM, AzureAD and PSWord Module. To do that, you have to start PowerShell as an Adminstrator and install them:

```
Install-Module AzureRM
Install-Module AzureAD
Install-Module PSWord 
```
Import-Module AzureRM
Import-Module AzureAD
Import-Module PSWord 
```
